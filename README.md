#reDownload
This is a pet project of mine where I (ab)use the reMarkable tablet's built in web-ui. Currently, the project is usefull for simply downloading everything into a folder. 
This is prototyped in python however, the intention is to move to something that's a bit more self contained. The vision for the future is to enable auth&upload to Microsoft Onedrive or Google Drive. Bonus if this is done with an actual GUI.
